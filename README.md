# Internship project

Create a todo app using react that can fetch data from the server and display the response in the UI.

**Required Features :**
* API response contains a list/array of tasks.
* A single task can have a title, a description and 1 of the 3 states (todo, in-progress, done)
* There should be 3 views/tabs (todo, in-progress, done)
* Store the api response using a global state manager (e.g *Context API*)
* Tasks should be able to be moved 1 step forward or backward either via drag or by clicking on a specific button (e.g **Move to todo**, **Move to In progress**, **Move to Done**)
* Task status changes should reflect both on the backend and fronted (only after successful response from the backend).
* Feel free to add additional feature(s) as you please but the previous ones must work as expected.

**Bonus :** 
- Add Test
